# JAVASCRIPT CLASSES


- Classes are templates for objects.<br>
- JavaScript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.<br>
- INHERITANCE is when properties and methods of a parent class extend to child classes.<br>
-'extends' keyword to creates a subclass.<br>
-'super' keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.<br>
-Static methods are called on the class, NOT but not on AN instances of the class.<br>
