# JAVASCRIPT CLASSES


-Classes are templates for objects.<br>
-JavaScript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.<br>
-Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.<br>
-We use the extends keyword to create a subclass.<br>
-The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.<br>
-Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.<br>
-In completing this lesson, youâ€™ve taken one step closer to writing efficient, production-level JavaScript.<br>
-Good luck as you continue to develop your skills and move into intermediate-level concepts.<br>
